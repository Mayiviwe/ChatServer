JavaChatServer is a multithreaded chat server built in Java that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate in real time. It demonstrates the use of TCP sockets, thread management, and basic client-server architecture, making it an excellent learning project for anyone exploring network programming. The server handles multiple clients simultaneously, broadcasting messages from one client to all others while managing client disconnections gracefully. This project is ideal for beginners learning Java networking and multithreading, as well as developers looking for a foundation to build more advanced chat applications with features like authentication, private messaging, or graphical user interfaces. Its simple and extensible design makes it a practical example of real-time communication in Java and a great showcase for networking skills on GitHub.
